## Getting Started

Getting started just takes 3 simple steps, each one is a command in the terminal.

1. Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Navigate inside the repository directory on your machine.
3. Host the directory with a local web server.

There are a few easy ways to achieve step number 3 depending on what you already have installed:

<details><summary>Node Package Manager (NPM)</summary>
<p>

> If you have NPM installed you can use the [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) NPM package.
> The neat thing about live-server is that it automatically refreshes the web page every time you change a file.
>
> If you don't have NPM installed you can download and install it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
>
> Once you have NPM, install live-server globally with `npm install --global live-server`.
>
> Then run the following commands in your terminal.
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/CodingTrain/Logo.git
> cd Logo
> live-server --port=8080 .
> ```
> Don't forget the dot at the end of the command on MacOS!
>
> Finally, you can open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser and you're away!
>
> Note that when you close the terminal window, the web server will stop as well.

<details><summary>Python 2.x</summary>
<p>

> You can use the [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) python module.
>
> If you don't have Python 2 installed you can download and install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
>
> Then run the following commands in your terminal.
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/CodingTrain/Logo.git
> cd Logo
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
> ```
> Finally, you can open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser and you're away!
>
> Note that when you close the terminal window, the web server will stop as well.

<details><summary>Python 3.x</summary>
<p>

> You can use the [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) python module.
>
> If you don't have Python 3 installed you can download and install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
>
>
> Then run the following commands in your terminal.
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/CodingTrain/Logo.git
> cd Logo
> python3 -m http.server 8080
> ```
> Finally, you can open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser and you're away!
>
> Note that when you close the terminal window, the web server will stop as well.
